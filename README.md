# Free Move
Allows for usage of movement keybinds while in a GUI.

Sprint and Sneak states are held while within a GUI.

## Bugs / Compatibility Issues / Requests
Submit an issue. 

Will not backport to older versions, and will not port to Forge. Anyone willing can do this by themself instead. I assume that it wouldn't be too much of a hassle to backport.

## Usage
Feel free to include this mod in any modpack, or to port/borrow this mod. Credit would be appreciated in either case.
